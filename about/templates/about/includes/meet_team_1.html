                Each person on our team brings a unique set of running abilities, travel experience 
                and guiding expertise to the table, but something that we all have in common is an 
                addiction to exploration, a borderline obsession with running and a love of helping 
                others experience the world in this very unique way.

                Our guides are certified wilderness first responders, practice Leave No Trace 
                principles and have guided over 130 running trips combined. When you join a trip 
                youâ€™ll be traveling and running with at least one (if not 2 or 3) of us - click
