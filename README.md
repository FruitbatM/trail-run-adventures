# Overview

The project was created as a **Milestone Project 4** as a part of **Diploma in Full Stack Software Development** with **Code Institute**. The project is developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework.

**TRΛIL RUN ΛDVENTURES** is a multi-page eCommerce web application for trail running enthusiasts and everyone who enjoys being outdoors.

Trail running is simply defined as going for a run at the heart of nature. It's an extremely all-round non-stadia sport that and you don't need to be high in the mountains to go trail running. You simply need to be in nature.

Please click [here](TESTING.md) for the testing process.


## Version Control

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) as a local repository and [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository were used for this project. Detailed elaboration please find below:

1. Create a remote repository in GitHub by clicking **"New repository"** on the main page<br>

2. Use **Code Institute Template**, put the repository name and click Create Repository making sure to select public<br>

3. Open the repository with [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/). By using Code Institue Template, initialisation including initial commit is done so no need to do `git init` command when open IDE, or to use `git push -u origin main` command for my first commit. `gitignore` file, which is very important for the project including some confidential information, is created with Code Institute template so not necessary to create it.<br>
