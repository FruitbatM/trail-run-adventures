Remember, this is the Alps, rocky and steep terrain, high alpine meadows, glaciers, peaks, streams, lakes and amazing scenery. The route takes us from Chamonix - France through Italy, Switzerland, and back to Chamonix.",
      "overview_paragraph_2": "This journey is fully supported with luggage transfers so you will only need to carry a day running pack, shuttles to and from Geneva airport, all accommodations and meals. The accommodation varies from mountain huts to hotels. Some of the huts only offer dormitories, in the hotel it will be twin rooms. Single occupancy is available for an additional cost. The Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB) is one of the most famous trail running and hiking routes and a dream for many trail runners around the world.",
      "overview_paragraph_3": "The path encircles Western Europe’s highest peak, and it combines inspiring mountain scenery with cultural vibrancy in the alpine regions of France, Switzerland and Italy. The tour is challenging, rewarding and enjoyable, there will be long and steep runs but still time to relax, to recover and to have a beer or two in the afternoon. The alps and the TMB is a challenging route, but you’ll run and hike with a light vest and in the company of an experienced International Mountain Leader (UIMLA) that will be with you all the time.",
